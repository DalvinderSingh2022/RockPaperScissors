# RockPaperScissors
Here is a basic version of the traditional Rock Paper Scissors game that uses JavaScript for the logic, HTML for the structure, and CSS for the design.
In this game, a player can select from Rock, Paper, or Scissors to compete against the computer.
Points are awarded according to the classic rules of the game, and the first player to reach 10 points is declared the winner.
